BenchmarkTools
  gh: https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl
  docs: https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl/blob/master/doc/manual.md
  notes: >
    Provides useful macros for benchmarking expressions, such as `@btime`. 

Compose
  url: 
  notes: >
    Declarative graphics library. Same original author as [Gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org/stable/),
    a ggplot2-inspired plotting library.

ImageFiltering
  notes: >
    Provides the kernels that we used with the convolutions stuff.

ImageMagick
  gh: https://github.com/JuliaIO/ImageMagick.jl
  notes: >
    A thin wrapper around [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/).
    They say not to use `using ImageMagick`; instead use `using FileIO`.
    Furthermore, they note that loading `Images` loads `FileIO` as well,
    so it is enough just to have `ImageMagick` installed and it will be used
    to open images with `load()`.
